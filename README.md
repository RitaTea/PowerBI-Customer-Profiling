# PowerBI-Customer-Profiling-
This project took me into the heart of loan analysis, focusing on optimizing customer targeting and loan product strategies for a fintech client. My analysis centered on key financial metrics like Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios, income levels, customer engagement, and demographic.
What I discovered was fascinating. I found a large group of customers— 63% —who were considered low-risk and easily qualified for loans. These customers generally had healthy DTI ratios and stable incomes. Digging deeper, I noticed that those with very low DTIs (below 0.35) were prime candidates for bigger loans, like car or property loans.
Income analysis confirmed a direct correlation between earnings and loan size preference, enabling targeted product development. Furthermore, I discovered a strong link between customer engagement and loan type. Highly engaged customers were significantly more likely to qualify for premium loan products, suggesting valuable cross-selling opportunities. Conversely, lower engagement correlated with smaller loan products.
Looking at demographics, I found that older customers, specifically those between 56 and 65, had the highest loan eligibility, likely due to more stable income. Younger customers, under 25, were more interested in loans for education. I also looked at loan eligibility through a gender lens, and found that slightly more men (53%) than women (47%) were eligible.
Based on these findings, I recommended a few key strategies. First, offering flexible loan structures tailored to individual income and risk profiles. Second, creating targeted marketing campaigns that speak directly to different customer segments. Third, launching financial inclusion initiatives to help low-income groups access smaller loans. And finally, enhancing customer engagement through personalized offers, especially for high-income customers.
This project was all about using data to personalize the loan experience, making sure the right products reach the right people, and ultimately helping the fintech company grow while also promoting financial inclusion.
